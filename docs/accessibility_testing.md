# EU Accessibility Compliance Summary

## Detailed Compliance Summary

### EU Accessibility Regulations and Standards 
The European Union has established **comprehensive accessibility laws** that apply to digital products and services, underpinned by standards like WCAG and EN 301 549. The two primary legal frameworks are the **EU Web Accessibility Directive (2016/2102)** and the **European Accessibility Act (2019/882)**. The Web Accessibility Directive (WAD) requires all public sector websites and mobile applications in EU member states to be accessible to people with disabilities ([Web Accessibility Directive - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Directive#:~:text=The%20Directive%20on%20the%20accessibility,3)) ([Web Accessibility Directive - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Directive#:~:text=The%20EU%27s%20new%20European%20Accessibility,much%20larger%20number%20of%20people)). It has been in force since 2018–2020 (with staged deadlines) and uses the harmonized European standard EN 301 549 to define accessibility requirements. The newer European Accessibility Act (EAA), passed in 2019, **extends accessibility requirements to key private sector products and services** (complementing the public-sector WAD) ([Web Accessibility Directive - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Accessibility_Directive#:~:text=The%20EU%27s%20new%20European%20Accessibility,much%20larger%20number%20of%20people)). The EAA must be adopted into national laws by June 28, 2022, and comes into effect on June 28, 2025 ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=Since%20the%20European%20Accessibility%20Act,enforced%20at%20that%20same%20point)) ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=However%2C%20another%20directive%20on%20the,into%20law%20by%C2%A0June%2028%2C%202022)). From that date onward, any company offering in-scope products or services in the EU (including foreign companies) must comply with EAA requirements, which cover a broad range of digital platforms.

### Scope of Products and Services Covered 
Under the EAA, a number of **critical digital products and services** are required to be accessible. These include **websites and mobile applications** for e-commerce, online banking, e-books, transport services, and other digital services used by the public ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=The%20EAA%20intends%20to%20harmonize,These%20products%20and%20services%20include)). In fact, e-commerce sites and their native mobile apps are explicitly listed as in-scope, along with computers, operating systems, self-service terminals (ATMs, ticket machines), smartphones, digital TV services, telephony services, and more ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=The%20EAA%20intends%20to%20harmonize,These%20products%20and%20services%20include)). The Web Accessibility Directive, on the other hand, specifically targets public sector websites and apps (e.g. government information portals, public university sites, official mobile apps) and excludes some sectors (like broadcasters and NGOs) or cases of disproportionate burden ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=Who%20is%20exempt%20from%20the,EU%20Web%20Accessibility%20Directive)). Between the WAD and the EAA, **virtually all types of digital platforms — public websites, private websites offering services or products, web applications, and native mobile apps — are required to meet accessibility standards** in the EU.

### WCAG 2.1 and Harmonized EN 301 549 Standards 
Both the WAD and EAA rely on technical standards to define what “accessible” means. The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** published by the W3C serve as the foundation. In particular, WCAG 2.1 (Level A and AA success criteria) is the baseline for current EU requirements. The European harmonized standard **EN 301 549** incorporates WCAG 2.1 **verbatim** (all Level A and AA success criteria) and adds several additional criteria specific to the European context ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=EN%20301%20549%20V3.2.1%20%282021,additional%20checkpoints%20added%20to%20it)). In simple terms, EN 301 549 can be thought of as “**WCAG 2.1 plus extra requirements**,” covering not only web content but also non-web documents, software, and other ICT features ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=EN%20301%20549%20V3.2.1%20%282021,additional%20checkpoints%20added%20to%20it)) ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=,1)). For example, EN 301 549 v3.2.1 includes all WCAG 2.1 success criteria and adds rules for things like real-time communication, biometric identification alternatives, and preservation of accessibility information in file conversions ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=,1)). This standard is the **common reference point**: the EU officially harmonized EN 301 549 as the standard that indicates conformance with the WAD’s requirements (and it is expected to be used similarly for the EAA) ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=wouldn%E2%80%99t%20know%20the%20EN%20301,and%20are%20harmonized%20to%20it)). In practice, this means that ensuring **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance** will satisfy most requirements, with some additional checks (from EN 301 549) to achieve 100% alignment with EU laws.

**WCAG 2.1 Alignment:** WCAG 2.1 introduced guidelines to support users with a broader range of needs (compared to WCAG 2.0), including criteria for mobile accessibility (such as Orientation, Reflow, Status messages, etc.). These WCAG 2.1 success criteria are all included in EN 301 549 and thus are required by EU law ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=The%20following%20table%20lists%20the,documents%20downloaded%20from%20the%20web)) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=Both%20versions%20build%20heavily%20on,documents%20downloaded%20from%20the%20web)). Notably, WCAG 2.1’s Level AA criteria (like text contrast 4.5:1, captions for prerecorded video, etc.) are the **minimum** standard for public sector websites under the WAD ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=The%20following%20table%20lists%20the,documents%20downloaded%20from%20the%20web)). Private sector services under the EAA will likewise need to meet these as a baseline. WCAG 2.0 (an older version) is no longer sufficient under current EU rules, since the harmonized standard was updated in 2021 to require WCAG 2.1 ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20changes%20to,provided%20for%20in%20the%20legislation)) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=Both%20versions%20build%20heavily%20on,documents%20downloaded%20from%20the%20web)). Therefore, any new digital platform should be built to WCAG 2.1 at least. 

**WCAG 2.2 and Future Updates:** WCAG 2.2 (published October 2023) extends WCAG 2.1 with a few additional success criteria. While WCAG 2.2 is not yet explicitly referenced in EU law, it is considered the forward-looking best practice, and an update of EN 301 549 to incorporate WCAG 2.2 is expected ([What's new in WCAG 2.2 - TetraLogical](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2023/10/05/whats-new-wcag-2.2/#:~:text=What%27s%20new%20in%20WCAG%202,needs%20of%20the%20European)) ([The European Accessibility Act != EN 301 549 - DEV Community](https://dev.to/emmadawsondev/the-european-accessibility-act-en-301-549-16o1#:~:text=The%20European%20Accessibility%20Act%20%21%3D,By%20fulfilling%20the%20requirements)). WCAG 2.2 remains backwards-compatible with WCAG 2.1 (except for a redundant criterion that was removed), so adopting it can only improve accessibility. It adds *new requirements* such as: ensuring keyboard focus indicators are more visible and not hidden by other content, providing alternatives to dragging movements, minimum target size for touch controls, consistent placement of help mechanisms, avoiding asking users to re-enter information, and providing alternative accessible authentication methods ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,which%20requires%20that%20information%20previously)) ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,alternative%20mechanisms%20for%20login%20processes)). These new WCAG 2.2 criteria (2 new Level A and 4 new Level AA criteria) address mobile and cognitive accessibility in particular (e.g. making sure touch targets are large enough and that users with cognitive impairments aren’t forced through memory tests when logging in) ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,which%20requires%20that%20information%20previously)) ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,alternative%20mechanisms%20for%20login%20processes)). Although not yet mandated by EU law, adhering to WCAG 2.2 would demonstrate a commitment to “going beyond compliance,” and it’s anticipated that future regulations (or future versions of EN 301 549) will incorporate these enhancements. In summary, **WCAG 2.1 AA is the current legal standard**, but **WCAG 2.2** provides additional best-practice criteria that developers should consider to future-proof their platforms.

### Alignment of the EAA with WCAG and EN 301 549 
The European Accessibility Act defines broad **functional accessibility requirements**, and for digital content it essentially points to the same success criteria defined in WCAG/EN 301 549. The EAA’s intention is to **harmonize accessibility across the EU internal market**, so it leverages the existing standards. In fact, national laws implementing the EAA in each country typically **reference EN 301 549 as the benchmark** ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=wouldn%E2%80%99t%20know%20the%20EN%20301,and%20are%20harmonized%20to%20it)). For example, Germany’s implementing law (the Barrierefreiheitsstärkungsgesetz), France’s Decree No. 2023-931, Italy’s Decree 82/2022, Ireland’s S.I. No. 636/2023, etc., all tie their technical requirements to EN 301 549 ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=wouldn%E2%80%99t%20know%20the%20EN%20301,and%20are%20harmonized%20to%20it)). This means that whether you are dealing with a public-sector website under the WAD or a private e-commerce app under the EAA, the **specific technical checks** for accessibility will be very similar – largely derived from WCAG success criteria. 

However, the EAA goes beyond web content alone. It also covers **non-web digital content and services** like electronic documents, ebooks, operating system interfaces, payment terminals, etc., so EN 301 549 includes chapters for software and non-web technology. For web developers, the key point is that **websites and web applications of companies in the EAA’s scope must comply with WCAG-based criteria**, and likewise their **mobile apps** must comply (even though WCAG was written for web, EN 301 549 provides an equivalent set of criteria for mobile apps in an annex) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=To%20note%3A%20Table%20A,actually%20apply%20to%20mobile%20applications)). In short, **the EAA fully aligns with WCAG 2.1 (through EN 301 549)** for web and mobile content, ensuring a unified standard. Where WCAG by itself might not cover a scenario, EN 301 549 fills the gap (e.g. requirements for things like real-time text in calls or biometric logins). Developers can confidently use **WCAG 2.1 AA (and applicable parts of EN 301 549)** as the checklist for compliance with both the Web Accessibility Directive and the EAA.

### Compliance Expectations for Websites and Mobile Applications 
For developers of websites, web applications, and native mobile applications, **compliance means meeting all the relevant accessibility criteria in the standards**. At a high level, digital content must be:
- **Perceivable:** Users must be able to perceive the information, regardless of disability. This involves providing text alternatives for images, captions for audio/video, sufficient color contrast, adaptable layouts, etc.
- **Operable:** Users must be able to operate the interface through various means. This includes full keyboard navigation support (or switch device support), enough time to read content, no problematic flashes, and accessible controls for gestures or other inputs.
- **Understandable:** Content and UI should be understandable and predictable. Use clear language, consistent navigation, descriptive labels and instructions, and help users avoid or correct input errors.
- **Robust:** The content must be robust enough to work with different assistive technologies and user agents. This means using proper HTML semantics or accessibility APIs so that screen readers and other AT can interpret the content reliably.

These four principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust – often abbreviated as **POUR**) underpin WCAG and thus the EU requirements. Concretely, a **web platform** is expected to satisfy all Level A and AA success criteria of WCAG 2.1. For example, **images must have alt text**, form fields must have labels, users must be able to navigate via keyboard with visible focus indicators, and so on. A **mobile app** is expected to offer the same level of accessibility: all UI elements should have accessible names, the app should support the platform’s accessibility features (like TalkBack, VoiceOver, dynamic text sizing), and meet the equivalent of WCAG criteria in its context (e.g. an app should allow usage in both portrait and landscape if possible, and ensure no element is too small to tap). **Responsiveness** is also a factor – web content should reflow and be usable on small screens and when zoomed (as required by WCAG 2.1’s Reflow criterion), and mobile apps should accommodate different device orientations and font size settings.

In addition to the core WCAG criteria, **EN 301 549 adds specific requirements** for certain situations. For instance, if a web application provides **real-time audio/video communication** (like a teleconferencing feature or VoIP calls), it should also provide real-time text support, captions for audio, and other accessibility features for users who are deaf or hard of hearing ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=2%205,way%20voice%20communication)) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=8%206,web%20pages%20with%20RTT%20functionality)). If **biometric identification** (fingerprint, face recognition, voice login) is used, the system must have an alternative method that doesn’t rely on a biological characteristic (so that users who can’t provide that biometric or cannot perform the action can still authenticate) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=Row%20Clause%20in%20v3,way%20voice%20communication)). If the product includes an **authoring tool** (for example, a rich text editor in a web app that lets users create content), it must support users in producing accessible content (preserving alt text in transformations, offering accessible templates, etc.) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=127%2011,accessibility%20and%20compatibility%20features%20Unconditional)) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=129%2011,accessibility%20and%20compatibility%20features%20Unconditional)). Moreover, any **documentation, support, or customer service** related to the digital service must be accessible as well ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=,EAA%2C%20as%20is%20product%20documentation)). This means user guides or help files should be available in an accessible format (e.g. HTML or tagged PDF) and support channels (like help desks or chatbots) should be usable by people with disabilities. The EAA explicitly brings **customer support channels and product documentation into scope** for accessibility compliance ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=,EAA%2C%20as%20is%20product%20documentation)).

In summary, the expectation is that **digital platforms are accessible by design** – a website or app should be usable by people with various disabilities (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive) without barriers. Meeting all relevant WCAG 2.1 AA criteria (and the few additional EU-specific requirements) is considered full compliance. The following sections provide a comprehensive **checklist** of those criteria for both web and mobile platforms, which can serve as a guide to ensure 100% compliance.

### Enforcement and Legal Consequences of Non-Compliance 
**Compliance is not just a guideline but a legal obligation** in the EU. If an organization fails to make its website or app accessible as required, there are enforcement mechanisms and potential penalties. Under the Web Accessibility Directive, each member state must monitor public sector websites/apps and ensure an enforcement procedure for non-compliance ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=The%20directive%20requires%20that%20all,decided%20by%20each%20member%20state)). Typically, public sector bodies must publish an accessibility statement and provide a way for users to report issues; if they don’t comply, oversight bodies can issue notices or other sanctions. The Directive left specific penalties to individual countries, so approaches vary. In some cases, repeated failure to comply could result in reputational consequences or legal action, though the emphasis for public sector has been on monitoring and remediation rather than fines. Still, by not meeting the 2020/2021 deadlines for accessibility, a public sector website is essentially **breaking EU law** ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=Can%20I%20be%20fined%20if,accessible%20website%20by%20the%20deadline)), and users have the right to complain and seek resolution.

For the private sector, the **European Accessibility Act is more explicit about penalties**. Because the EAA covers commercial products and services, member states are implementing fines and enforcement regimes to ensure businesses take it seriously. Each country’s law will define the penalties for EAA non-compliance, and these **penalties can be substantial**. For example, Germany’s law allows fines up to **€500,000** for companies that do not meet the accessibility requirements ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=,this%20market%20to%20prioritize%20accessibility)) (with the possibility of even suspending services until compliance is achieved ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=,this%20market%20to%20prioritize%20accessibility))). France can impose fines from about €5,000 up to **€250,000**, and may publicly name non-compliant companies (which poses a reputational risk) ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=%2A%20France%3A%20Non,severely%20damage%20a%20brand%27s%20reputation)). Spain’s fines can range as high as **€300,000** for serious violations ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=%2A%20France%3A%20Non,severely%20damage%20a%20brand%27s%20reputation)). Ireland and Austria anticipate fines up to **€200,000** in their legislation ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=,and%20potential%20suspension%20of%20services)). Many countries also include provisions for **daily penalties** (for ongoing violations), mandatory accessibility audits, or orders to fix issues within a given timeframe ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=,compliance%20status)) ([Understanding the European Accessibility Act and Its Penalties for Non-Compliance — Inclusive Web](https://www.inclusiveweb.co/accessibility-resources/understanding-the-european-accessibility-act-and-its-penalties-for-non-compliance#:~:text=Beyond%20Fines%3A%20Additional%20Consequences)). In extreme cases or persistent non-compliance, regulators could even prohibit the sale of an inaccessible product or service in the market until it is fixed. 

In short, **non-compliance in the EU can lead to hefty fines, legal orders, and public enforcement actions**. Businesses risk not only financial penalties but also damage to their brand if they are called out for failing to support users with disabilities. The **cost of ignoring accessibility far outweighs the effort to comply**, especially given the clear timelines (the EAA’s 2025 deadline) and the wide reach of these laws (covering both EU companies and those abroad offering services into the EU ([European Accessibility Act and EN 301 549 Explained - Applause](https://www.applause.com/blog/european-accessibility-act-en-301-549#:~:text=Since%20the%20European%20Accessibility%20Act,enforced%20at%20that%20same%20point))). Organizations should therefore treat accessibility with the same seriousness as other compliance areas. The next section provides a **thorough checklist** to ensure that web and mobile applications meet all the required accessibility criteria under these standards.

## Thorough Accessibility Checklist

The following is a comprehensive **accessibility compliance checklist** structured for web and mobile platforms. It covers all requirements needed to achieve 100% conformance with EU accessibility regulations, including WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria (and relevant WCAG 2.2 updates), as well as additional points from EN 301 549. This checklist is provided in two formats:

- **JSON format**: a machine-readable structured list of criteria, suitable for use in automated validation tools or AI systems.
- **Tabular format**: a human-readable table of accessibility requirements, organized by category (topic) for easy review.

Each section is divided into **Web** and **Mobile** to address the specific considerations of web applications versus native mobile applications (though there is overlap). **Web accessibility** focuses on websites and web apps (HTML/CSS/JS content in browsers), while **mobile accessibility** focuses on iOS/Android native apps and responsive behavior. Together, these cover the full spectrum of front-end digital accessibility.

### Web Accessibility Checklist (Tabular Format)

The table below categorizes each **web accessibility requirement** by topic and provides the specific criteria to check. This list ensures a website or web application meets all EU-required accessibility checkpoints (WCAG 2.1 AA and relevant extensions). Use this as a human-readable reference to validate compliance:

| **Category**                    | **Web Accessibility Requirement**                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perceivable: Text Alternatives** | All non-text content (images, icons, infographics, etc.) has an **equivalent text alternative** that serves the same purpose or conveys the same information (e.g. `<img>` elements have appropriate `alt` text) ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,alternative%20mechanisms%20for%20login%20processes)). Decorative images are marked so they can be ignored by assistive technology (for instance, using an empty alt attribute or CSS backgrounds). |
| **Perceivable: Time-based Media** | Pre-recorded **videos** have **captions** for all spoken audio and significant sounds (captions should be synchronized and accurate). Pre-recorded **audio-only** content has a **transcript** available so that users who cannot hear can read the content. For videos that convey important visual information, an **audio description** or text alternative is provided to describe those visuals. Live multimedia (if present) should have live captions or sign language interpretation as needed to be accessible (per regulatory requirements for live content). |
| **Perceivable: Adaptability**   | Content is structured semantically: headings (`<h1>...<h6>`) outline the page organization, lists use proper `<ul>/<ol>` elements, and data tables have `<th>` headers for columns/rows. All form fields have associated **labels** (visible text or aria-label) and instructions where needed. The reading and navigation order (as determined by the HTML DOM and ARIA landmarks) is logical and consistent with the visual presentation, so that screen reader users perceive the content in a meaningful sequence. |
| **Perceivable: Distinguishable** | **Color and contrast**: Text has sufficient contrast against its background (generally at least 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text or UI components). No information is conveyed by **color alone** – if color indicates status or categories, an additional indicator (like text or shape) is provided. Users can **resize text** (zoom in up to 200%) without breaking the layout or losing content; on zoom or small screens, content reflows so that horizontal scrolling isn’t required ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=Both%20versions%20build%20heavily%20on,documents%20downloaded%20from%20the%20web)) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=v3,documents%20downloaded%20from%20the%20web)). There are no problematic flashes that could trigger seizures (nothing flashes >3 times/second unless it’s below the flash threshold). Audio that plays automatically for more than a few seconds has a pause/stop control or is avoided altogether. |
| **Operable: Keyboard Accessibility** | **Keyboard navigation** is fully supported: all interactive elements (links, buttons, controls) can be focused and activated using a keyboard alone (e.g. via Tab, Enter/Space, arrow keys for menus). There are no “keyboard traps” – keyboard focus can move into any interactive component and exit it as needed (for example, modal dialogs can be closed with keyboard alone). Keyboard focus has a **visible indicator** (such as a highlighted outline), so it’s always clear which element has focus ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,which%20requires%20that%20information%20previously)). |
| **Operable: Navigation and Structure** | Users can navigate content in a logical way. Every page has a **descriptive title** (`<title>`) that indicates its purpose. If the site has repetitive content (like a header menu), a **“Skip to main content”** link or ARIA landmarks are provided to bypass those blocks. Link text is descriptive of the link’s target (or its context makes the purpose clear) – no ambiguous “click here” links without context. The tab order and focus order follow an intuitive flow that matches the visual layout, helping users who navigate sequentially. If a multi-step process or form is used, steps are indicated and consistent. Also, navigation menus and other repeated interface elements appear in a consistent order on every page (consistency helps predictability). |
| **Operable: Enough Time & Movement** | Users are given **sufficient time** to read and use content. If there are any time limits (e.g., session timeouts), users can extend or turn off the limit (except where necessary, like security). Any moving or auto-updating content (carousels, animations) can be **paused, stopped, or hidden** by the user to avoid distraction. Nothing essential on the site requires rapid reaction or timing that a user with a disability cannot accommodate – alternatives or adjustments are provided if so. |
| **Operable: Input Modalities**   | **Pointer gestures** and other inputs are made accessible. If a feature uses a complex gesture (such as a swipe, drag-and-drop, or multi-finger gesture), a simpler single-pointer activation (like a click or tap) is available to accomplish the same action (so users who cannot perform complex gestures are not excluded) ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,user%20later%20in%20the%20process)). If any function is triggered by device **motion or orientation** (like shaking or rotating a device to trigger an action), an alternative control (like an on-screen button) is provided in case the user can’t perform that motion or is using assistive tech that overrides motion. All interactive elements have an accessible **name that matches any visible label** (so, for example, icons or buttons with visible text also have that text in their accessibility label, ensuring compatibility with voice control software). **Touch targets** are designed to be large enough and well-spaced for users with limited dexterity — aim for at least around 44×44 CSS pixels for clickable areas (as recommended in WCAG 2.2) to prevent touch errors. |
| **Operable: Focus & Visibility** | When elements receive focus, they do not become hidden behind other content, and critical content is not obscured. For instance, if a pop-up opens, keyboard focus moves into it and the pop-up is fully visible on screen. Focus indicators are clearly visible (meeting size/contrast criteria as updated in WCAG 2.2), helping users track keyboard focus. No part of the interface is structured such that an element getting focus causes the view to scroll or shift in a way that the focused item is off-screen. |
| **Understandable: Language & Readability** | The **language** of the page is specified in the code (e.g., `<html lang="en"> for English), and if parts of the page use a different language, those parts are marked appropriately (so screen readers switch to the correct language profile). The content avoids unnecessary jargon or idioms; when specialized vocabulary is used, explanations are provided (this is not a strict WCAG requirement at AA, but it’s good practice for understanding). Instructions and labels are clear and concise. |
| **Understandable: Predictability** | The website behaves in a consistent and expected way. No interface element causes a **surprising change of context** just by receiving focus alone (for example, merely focusing a dropdown won’t automatically jump to a new page). Changes of context (like navigating to another page or revealing new content) generally occur only when the user **activates** something (e.g., clicking a link or button), or the user is warned in advance. Consistent branding and functionality: elements that repeat, such as navigation menus, footer links, icons, have consistent naming and placement across pages. If help or support is available, it’s presented consistently on each page (e.g., a help link or chat icon is always in the same spot). |
| **Understandable: Input Assistance** | **Form field labels and instructions** are present whenever the user must input information. Important fields indicate their required format (for example, “Date (YYYY-MM-DD)” or input masks). When a user submits a form with errors, the errors are clearly highlighted and **explained in text** (not just color or an icon). Error messages let the user know what went wrong and, if possible, how to fix it (for instance, “Your password must be at least 8 characters”). For more complex forms, suggestions for correction are provided when appropriate (WCAG 2.1 AA requires error suggestions for inputs like dates, where feasible). The interface is designed to **prevent mistakes**: critical actions require confirmation, and irreversible actions warn the user beforehand. Additionally, per WCAG 2.2, users are **not forced to re-enter data** that was already provided earlier in a multi-step process – previously entered information is remembered or prefilled to avoid redundant work ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,alternative%20mechanisms%20for%20login%20processes)) ([WCAG 2.2 Is Here (Finally): 4 Takeaways](https://www.boia.org/blog/wcag-2.2-is-here#:~:text=,alternative%20mechanisms%20for%20login%20processes)). |
| **Robust: Compatibility**       | The website is built on **valid, semantic HTML/CSS/JS** so that user agents (browsers, assistive technologies) can reliably interpret it. All interactive components (custom widgets, media players, etc.) use ARIA roles and properties where needed to **expose their name, role, value** to assistive tech (e.g., a custom slider control should have `role="slider"` and ARIA attributes for its value). Status updates and dynamic changes are conveyed to assistive technologies – for example, using `aria-live` regions or focus management to announce changes (so if a form validation result appears or content loads dynamically, screen reader users are notified). The site is tested with multiple assistive technologies (screen readers like NVDA/JAWS, voice control like Dragon, etc.) to ensure compatibility. |
| **Additional: Documentation & Support** | If the website provides **downloadable content** (PDFs, Word documents, etc.), those files are made accessible (tagged PDFs with reading order and alt text, accessible Office documents with styles, etc.), or an accessible HTML alternative is provided. The site includes an **Accessibility Statement** (for public sector sites this is required by EU law) declaring its conformance level (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA) and offering a way for users to request accessible content or give feedback. Any **customer support or contact mechanisms** on the site are accessible – for example, if there’s a live chat, it works with screen readers; if there’s a phone number, an alternative like email or text chat is available for users who can’t use a phone. Help documentation or FAQs are written in plain language and available in accessible formats. |
| **Additional: Advanced Features** | For advanced web app features: If the web application includes **real-time communication** (such as audio/video calls), it provides accessibility features like real-time text chat for those who cannot speak or hear, and options for enabling **captions on live calls** or webinars. Any video conferencing element should allow for pinning sign language interpreters or provide an accessible interface for third-party captioning services ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=22%206,content%20displays%20video%20with%20synchronized)) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=28%207,can%20be%20applied%20to%20downloaded)). If **biometric login or identification** is used on the site (e.g., fingerprint login on a web-based platform), there is an alternative method (like PIN or password login) for users who cannot use the biometric option ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=1%205,way%20voice%20communication)). Likewise, if the web app serves as an **authoring tool** (for example, a content management system or an online document editor), it should not only be usable by people with disabilities but also help ensure that content created with it can be output in an accessible form (preserving structure, alternative texts, etc.). |

### Mobile Accessibility Checklist (Tabular Format)

Below is the **mobile accessibility** checklist, focusing on native mobile app considerations. Many principles mirror the web criteria, but here they are tailored to mobile UI/UX and platform-specific features. Ensure a mobile app meets these requirements for full compliance:

| **Category**                   | **Mobile Accessibility Requirement**                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Perceivable: Text & Images** | All non-text elements in the app’s interface have **accessible text** equivalents. This means every icon, image, and button has an accessibility label or content description that screen readers can read. For example, if there’s a button with only an icon (like a trash can for “Delete”), that button has an invisible label like “Delete” for VoiceOver/TalkBack. No meaningful graphic is left without a description. |
| **Perceivable: Audio/Video**   | Multimedia within the app is made accessible just like on the web. **Videos have captions** (or the app integrates with the device’s caption settings). **Audio content has transcripts** available if it’s something like a podcast within the app. If the app plays video with spoken dialogue and visual elements, provide an **audio description** or ensure the important visuals are described in narration. The app should also allow users to control media playback easily (play/pause, stop audio) and toggle captions or audio descriptions. |
| **Perceivable: Adaptability**  | The app’s layout and content adapt to different displays and user preferences. The app does not force a particular screen orientation unless absolutely necessary; it works in both **portrait and landscape** orientations (if used on a phone or tablet) ([Latest changes to accessibility standard | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/latest-changes-accessibility-standard#:~:text=To%20note%3A%20Table%20A,actually%20apply%20to%20mobile%20applications)). Content reflows or adjusts when the device is rotated. The app also supports **text scaling** – if a user increases the system font size or uses Dynamic Type (on iOS) / Font Size (on Android), the app’s text enlarges accordingly without clipping or overlapping. No content should be cut off when larger text is used; instead, layouts should be flexible (scrollable if needed). Ensure that all essential information remains perceivable at larger font sizes. |
| **Perceivable: Contrast & Color** | The visual design of the app uses accessible color choices. All text in the app maintains sufficient **color contrast** against its background (meeting at least the 4.5:1 ratio for normal text). This applies to text on buttons, labels, and any text in images. If the app offers a **dark mode** or high contrast mode, it has been tested for readability (e.g., no light grey text on white in light mode, or dark grey on black in dark mode that would fail contrast). The app does not rely on color alone to convey information – for instance, if items in a list are colored differently to indicate status, there should also be an icon or label indicating the status. |
| **Operable: Keyboard & Focus** | The app is fully usable with alternative input methods like a **Bluetooth keyboard or switch control**. This means every interactive element (buttons, links, text fields) can be focused using the keyboard (usually via the Tab key or equivalent navigation keys provided by Switch Control or Android’s accessibility menu). The **focus order** when navigating via keyboard follows a logical sequence through the UI controls. There are no traps where focus gets stuck. For example, if a dialog opens, the focus moves into the dialog and can move back out when the dialog is closed. **Focus indicators** are present: if a user tabs to a button, the button is visually highlighted (this might be a default iOS/Android behavior if using standard controls). If the platform’s default focus indicator isn’t obvious, ensure a custom one so users can see where they are. |
| **Operable: Touch & Gestures** | All app features that respond to **touch gestures** are designed to be accessible to users who cannot perform complex gestures. If the app uses multi-touch gestures (like pinch or a three-finger swipe) or custom swipe gestures, there are alternative ways to perform these actions. Often this means providing on-screen controls or simpler gestures. For example, if swiping left deletes an email in a mail app, also provide a delete button or an actions menu. If a long-press is required to open a context menu, ensure that the same can be done with a single tap on a visible button. By providing alternatives, users who have motor disabilities or who use assistive touch tools can still activate all functions. Additionally, common navigation gestures (like swiping through carousel items) should not be the only way—arrow buttons or similar controls should be present. |
| **Operable: Touch Target Size** | **Touch targets** in the app are comfortably large. Small controls can be hard to hit, especially for users with larger fingers or motor impairments. The app’s buttons, icons, and other tappable areas are around **44×44 points/pixels or larger** (Apple’s guideline is 44 points, Android’s is about 48 dp) or otherwise designed with adequate spacing so that users don’t accidentally hit the wrong target. If space is limited, padding around icons can ensure the active touch area is enlarged invisibly. This reduces the likelihood of input errors and is now part of newer WCAG guidance (WCAG 2.2’s target size criterion). |
| **Operable: Motion & Sensor**  | If the app uses **device motion or orientation** as input (for instance, shake to undo, or tilt to move a character in a game), it provides alternatives for users who cannot or choose not to perform those motions. For example, a “Shake to undo” feature should also be achievable by tapping an “Undo” button. Additionally, the app should respect system settings like “**Reduce Motion**” – if the user has enabled a setting to reduce motion (to avoid dizziness or distraction), the app should minimize things like parallax effects or animations accordingly. Any feature that requires physical motion should either be optional or off by default with a manual control as an alternative. |
| **Operable: Timing**           | Similar to web, if any part of the app is **time-dependent** (like a quiz that auto-submits after a timeout or a screen that disappears after X seconds), the user should have control or warning. Provide alerts before time runs out and allow extension where feasible. Also, if the app has animations or auto-scrolling content (e.g., an automatically sliding tutorial), allow the user to pause or control it. Users with cognitive or motor disabilities might need more time to react. Make sure the app doesn’t have sections that require rapid gestures or responses that could exclude some users (or provide a way to adjust the speed/difficulty). |
| **Understandable: Labels & Feedback** | All interactive elements have **clear labels** and convey their purpose. The text on buttons and controls is simple and descriptive (e.g., say “Send Message” instead of just “Send” if context isn’t obvious). Importantly, the programmatic accessibility label for each element matches the visual label (so that VoiceOver announces the same text a sighted user sees, preventing confusion). The app provides real-time **feedback** for user actions: for instance, if a button triggers a process, there is feedback like a loading spinner (with an accessibility label like “Loading…” so it's announced). Form fields might use hint text to guide input, and that hint is available to assistive tech as well. |
| **Understandable: Consistency** | The app’s screens and controls behave consistently to meet user expectations. Common controls (like navigation bars, menus, form layouts) appear in a consistent place and style throughout the app. If an icon represents a certain action, it does so everywhere (for example, a heart icon always means “favorite” across all screens). This consistency helps users, including those with cognitive impairments, to learn and predict the interface. There are no unexpected changes: e.g., tapping a menu icon opens the menu overlay; it doesn’t suddenly navigate to a different app or perform a destructive action without confirmation. If the app has a multi-step workflow, it maintains consistency in how the user proceeds (back/next buttons in the same location, etc.). |
| **Understandable: Error Handling** | The app makes it easy for users to recover from mistakes. If a user enters invalid data or leaves a required field blank, the app displays a clear **error message** explaining the issue (e.g., “Password must be at least 8 characters”). These messages are coded such that screen readers will announce them (for instance, by focusing the error message or using live regions on mobile). The problematic form field might also be highlighted and described. The user is often taken directly to the field with the error (focus moves to it) and the error is described. The app also avoids causing errors in the first place by using helpful inputs (like date pickers to prevent date format errors, or disabled state for ineligible options). |
| **Understandable: Assistance & Help** | The app provides help where needed in an accessible way. If there are any tutorials, onboarding sequences, or tooltips, they are reachable by all users (e.g., VoiceOver can read them, and they don’t vanish too quickly). Complex controls might have instructions that are accessible via screen reader (perhaps using accessibility hints on iOS or content descriptions on Android to give additional guidance). Importantly, the app doesn’t suddenly do things on its own without user initiation – no unexpected screen changes or context switches that could confuse users. If the app integrates a help center or FAQ, that content is text-based and readable by assistive tech. Any support links (email, phone, chat) are clearly provided and accessible. |
| **Robust: Assistive Tech Compatibility** | The app is thoroughly tested with **mobile assistive technologies**. With VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android) turned on, the app is fully navigable and all elements are announced correctly. Each control’s **role, name, and state** are exposed: for example, a toggle announces “Switch button – ON” when active. Custom controls use accessibility APIs: e.g., a custom checkbox view on Android uses `AccessibilityNodeInfo` to announce itself as a checkbox and reports checked/unchecked status. The reading order for screen readers is logical (usually follows the visual order). The app also works with screen magnifiers/zoom – content scales and scrolls appropriately. If users use voice commands (like saying “Tap OK” with Voice Control/Switch Access), because labels are clear, these commands will activate the correct controls. No part of the app is inaccessible due to compatibility issues (such as using an unsupported control that a screen reader can’t interact with). |
| **Robust: Use of Platform Accessibility Features** | The app leverages built-in platform features to enhance accessibility. For instance, it uses standard UI controls where possible (since these come with accessibility support out-of-the-box). In cases of custom UI, developers have set accessibility properties (traits on iOS, accessibility delegate on Android) so that those custom components are recognized by assistive tech. The app supports **Dynamic Type** (iOS) and **Font Size** settings (Android) for text scaling, **Invert Colors/High Contrast** modes – meaning the app doesn’t hard-code backgrounds or text in a way that breaks when the OS inverts colors or applies a high-contrast theme. It respects **Reduce Transparency** or **Increase Contrast** settings by not relying on very faint text or overly transparent elements. Essentially, the app “plays nice” with any accessibility preference the user has turned on at the OS level. |
| **Additional: Accessible Documentation & Support** | If the app includes help pages, user guides, or any documentation inside it, those are accessible (text can be read by screen readers, any images in help have alt text, etc.). If the app opens or links to external documentation (like a PDF manual or a website FAQ), those resources meet accessibility standards or an alternate accessible version is provided. Contacting support from the app is accessible – e.g., if there’s a support chat embedded, it is keyboard-focusable and readable; if it opens an email, it pre-fills information but lets the user use their accessible email app. The idea is that **support and documentation don’t become barriers**: they should be as usable as the rest of the app for someone with a disability. |
| **Additional: Notifications & Alerts** | The app’s **notifications and alerts** are accessible. When the app presents a system notification (push notification), the text is succinct and meaningful (so it’s easily understood when read aloud by VoiceOver/TalkBack). If the app uses custom in-app alerts or toast messages, these are coded to be announced to screen reader users (Android toast messages are automatically read by TalkBack; for custom alerts on iOS, UIAccessibilityPostNotification announcements might be used). Any critical alert sound is accompanied by a visual alert for those who can’t hear, and vice versa. |
| **Additional: General Compliance** | The app meets all relevant clauses of EN 301 549 for software. This includes avoiding any use of accessibility-breaking practices (for example, not disabling system accessibility services, not using images of text for important content unless absolutely necessary). The app does not override user settings (like forcing small text or specific colors). It has undergone an **accessibility audit** to verify all the above points. In effect, the app achieves the equivalent of WCAG 2.1 AA in a native context. |

*(Note: Many mobile app requirements correspond to WCAG criteria even if the wording differs. Mobile apps should aim for parity with WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria as applied via the mobile OS’s accessibility framework. The checklist above ensures that if followed, a native app would meet the spirit and letter of those guidelines.)*

## Implementation Best Practices

Achieving and maintaining compliance with accessibility standards requires integrating accessibility into the entire development lifecycle. Below are best practices, tools, and strategies to help developers and teams build **accessible digital platforms** proactively, rather than trying to fix issues late in the process. These recommendations cover automated testing tools, development workflow integration, and design principles to ensure accessibility from the start.

### Tools and Automated Validation 
Leveraging the right tools can make accessibility verification more efficient. **Automated testing tools** can catch a large portion of common issues (typically 30-50% of WCAG violations) quickly. Some recommended tools and solutions include:

- **Browser Extensions and Scanners**: Tools like **WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)** and **axe DevTools** (by Deque) can analyze web pages for accessibility problems. They highlight missing alt text, contrast issues, form labeling problems, and more. These are great for spot-checking individual pages during development.
- **Continuous Integration (CI) Automation**: Integrate accessibility checks into your CI/CD pipeline. For example, use **axe-core** or **Pa11y** in automated test suites to run accessibility tests on each build. This way, any new code that introduces an accessibility regression can be caught immediately. Many testing frameworks (like Jest, Cypress, or Selenium) have plugins to incorporate axe for accessibility assertions.
- **Lighthouse**: Google’s Lighthouse tool (available in Chrome DevTools and as a CLI) includes an Accessibility audit that scores a page and lists issues. It’s a quick way to get a broad overview of where improvements are needed.
- **Specialized Testing Software**: Consider platforms like **Siteimprove Accessibility**, **Level Access**, or **Accessibility Insight** that provide more extensive auditing and tracking. These can scan entire sites and help manage the fixing of issues. Automated solutions can also produce reports needed for compliance documentation.
- **Assistive Technology for Testing**: While not automated, it’s important to use screen readers (NVDA, JAWS on Windows; VoiceOver on Mac and iOS; TalkBack on Android) during testing. This helps ensure that what automated tools *assume* is accessible is actually usable in reality. Similarly, try voice control software (like Dragon NaturallySpeaking or built-in voice commands) to navigate your UI, and use keyboard-only navigation to simulate switch control users.
- **Color Contrast Analyzers**: Tools like the **Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)** can be used by designers and developers to pick color combinations that meet contrast ratios. Integrating this into design tools (Figma, Adobe XD plugins for accessibility) can catch contrast issues early.
- **Code Linters**: Use linters and static analysis. For example, **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y** for React will warn about missing accessibility attributes in JSX. There are similar linters for HTML that can flag improper ARIA usage or missing attributes (like `<img>` without alt).
- **Unit Testing for Accessibility**: For component libraries or design systems, write unit tests that ensure components meet basic accessibility (for instance, a Modal component test can verify that it traps focus when open and restores focus on close).

By using these tools regularly, developers can identify violations of WCAG/EN 301 549 early and often. Remember that while automation is extremely useful, it **cannot catch everything** – around 50% of issues (like logical reading order, proper usage of headings, appropriate link text, etc.) still require human judgment ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=The%20best%20place%20to%20start,website%E2%80%99s%20compliance%20with%20the%20directive)). Therefore, use automated tools as an aid, not a replacement, for manual review. As Siteimprove’s guide suggests, **combine automated testing with a manual checklist** and, if possible, expert review ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=The%20best%20place%20to%20start,website%E2%80%99s%20compliance%20with%20the%20directive)).

### Integrating Accessibility into Development Workflow 
Making a product accessible is easiest when accessibility is embedded in the development process from day one. Here’s a structured approach to weave accessibility into each phase of the workflow:

- **Planning and Requirements**: Include accessibility as a core requirement for every project. Define clear acceptance criteria related to accessibility for each user story or feature (e.g., “As a user with low vision, I can enlarge text to 200% without losing content”). Allocate time and resources for accessibility tasks. Educate the team on relevant legal obligations (WAD, EAA) so everyone knows compliance is not optional but mandatory.
- **Design Phase**: Adopt **inclusive design principles**. Designers should follow best practices like using sufficient color contrast in mockups, designing forms with clear labels and error states, and ensuring interactive elements are clearly indicated. Provide designers with an **accessibility checklist** (focused on visual and UX aspects) during the design review. If using a design system, ensure it has accessible components (for example, check that color palettes meet contrast requirements, that focus states are designed for buttons/links, etc.). Early design decisions are crucial – for instance, avoid fancy UI controls that have no accessible equivalent. Favor simplicity and clarity in UX. Also, plan for responsive behavior so that content works on different screen sizes (this aids both mobile use and zoom/reflow needs).
- **Development Phase**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA correctly from the start. Developers should be familiar with common patterns (like how to make a modal dialog accessible, how to mark up navigation menus, etc.). Integrate the **automated linters and CI tests** as mentioned above, so that during development, code that breaks accessibility gets flagged. Treat those failures with the same severity as unit test failures. Adopt a practice of performing a quick keyboard navigation test and running a tool like WAVE on every new page or component built (this can catch obvious issues immediately).
- **Testing Phase**: Go beyond standard functional testing – include **accessibility testing in QA**. This includes running automated test suites for accessibility, but also manual testing sessions. Create a test plan that covers using the site with only a keyboard, using it with a screen reader, high contrast mode, zoom to 400%, etc. Ensure testers are trained to identify accessibility issues. Some teams include people with disabilities in beta testing to get direct feedback. Remember to test on multiple browsers and devices, because assistive tech support can vary (e.g., test with VoiceOver in Safari and NVDA in Firefox, etc., as they might announce content differently). The Web Accessibility Directive mandates an “adequate and effective enforcement procedure” which implies that sites may be audited; by self-testing thoroughly, you preempt any issues an external audit would find ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=The%20directive%20requires%20that%20all,decided%20by%20each%20member%20state)).
- **Deployment and Maintenance**: Before each release, include an accessibility review in the go/no-go checklist. After deployment, monitor user feedback – users may report accessibility issues through the feedback channel (especially since public sector sites must provide a way for users to flag accessibility problems). Treat these reports with high priority and address them promptly. Also, schedule **periodic accessibility audits** even after launch (e.g., every 6 months or at major version updates, have an accessibility expert review key flows to catch any drift from standards).
- **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of accessibility decisions and known issues. For public sector, maintain the Accessibility Statement which should list any areas that aren’t fully compliant and plans to fix them. This documentation not only fulfills legal requirements but also guides future team members and avoids regressions (developers know what not to break).
- **Training and Awareness**: Regularly train the team (developers, QA, designers, product managers) on accessibility. Accessibility guidelines and assistive technology evolve (for example, WCAG 2.2’s new criteria). Ensuring the team stays updated will help integrate new best practices continuously. Make accessibility a part of the team culture – perhaps by having an “accessibility champion” on the team who can assist others, or by including people with disabilities in design discussions or testing phases for empathetic insight.

By integrating these steps, **accessibility becomes a natural part of the workflow**, not an afterthought. The U.S. Section 508 guidance on development lifecycle (which parallels EU requirements) emphasizes testing at each step and involving users, which ultimately reduces the cost and effort of fixes later ([Effective Methods and Tools for Incorporating Accessibility Conformance Validation within Development Processes | Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/develop/incorporating-accessibility-conformance/#:~:text=The%20integration%20of%20accessibility%20conformance,into%20your%20development%20life%20cycle)) ([Effective Methods and Tools for Incorporating Accessibility Conformance Validation within Development Processes | Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/develop/incorporating-accessibility-conformance/#:~:text=Plan%3A)). In other words, catching an issue in the design phase (or avoiding it entirely by designing accessibly) is far easier than re-coding components after development. One source noted that *“fixing existing websites with accessibility issues can take longer and be more challenging than building new websites with accessibility in mind from the start”* ([The EU Web Accessibility Directive: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.siteimprove.com/blog/the-eu-web-accessibility-directive-faq/#:~:text=Fixing%20existing%20websites%20with%20accessibility,to%20your%20organization%E2%80%99s%20work%20processes)) – so investing upfront pays off.

### Designing Accessible User Interfaces from the Start 
To avoid costly retrofits, it’s best to **bake in accessibility** during design and initial development. Here are best practices for designing UI with accessibility in mind:

- **Follow UX Design Guidelines for Accessibility**: Both Apple and Google provide extensive Human Interface Guidelines / Material Design guidance for accessibility. For example, Apple’s guidelines recommend minimum text sizes, sufficient color contrast, and dynamic type support; Google’s Material Design has accessibility sections for color, layout, and navigation. Adhering to these platform guidelines will inherently address many issues.
- **Use Established Design Patterns**: Many accessibility issues arise from custom widgets that behave unusually. Where possible, use standard HTML elements (for web) or native controls (for mobile) which have known accessibility behavior. If custom components are needed, model their interaction on standard patterns (e.g., make a custom dropdown behave like an HTML `<select>` with similar ARIA roles and keyboard interactions as described in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices).
- **Accessible Color Choices**: Choose a color palette that meets contrast requirements from the start. Ensure that your brand colors include sufficiently dark variants for text on light backgrounds, and vice versa. Also consider color blindness – use tools to simulate how your interface looks for common color deficiencies, and avoid color combinations that might be indistinguishable (like red/green for status without additional indicators).
- **Typography and Layout**: Use a font size that is easily readable (no tiny text). Allow text to scale – this often means avoiding fixed-height containers that can’t expand if text is larger. Ensure line height and spacing can accommodate larger text (WCAG has an advisory for text spacing when zoomed). Design with fluid layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and zoom levels; using relative units (%, em, rem) instead of absolute (px) can help with scalability.
- **Interactive Element Design**: Make sure that interactive elements are clearly distinguishable – for instance, links should be visually distinct (underlined or styled) not just relying on color, and buttons should look like buttons. Provide visible focus states in the design specs (not leaving it to default browser outlines unless those are clearly visible). Plan for error states in forms (design how an error message appears and where, ensuring it will be adjacent to the field or otherwise programmatically linked).
- **Content Strategy**: Work with content authors to ensure that things like alt text, link text, and error messages are meaningful. Often, accessibility is improved by good content (e.g., an error message that anyone can understand benefits all users). If the team includes technical writers or content strategists, have them contribute to writing clear, simple language for UI text and instructions. This helps users with cognitive disabilities and those who speak other languages.
- **Inclusive User Testing**: In the design validation stage, if possible, conduct usability testing with users with disabilities. They can provide insight that purely technical checks might miss. For instance, they might point out if a certain workflow is confusing or if the wording of a label is ambiguous. Early feedback can lead to design adjustments that improve accessibility and overall UX.
- **Avoid Known Anti-Patterns**: Certain design choices are known to cause accessibility headaches. For example, avoid putting important text solely in images; if you must use an image of text (like a logo or a custom-styled heading), ensure there’s a high-quality text alternative. Avoid overly verbose placeholder text that vanishes when typing (which can hurt users with cognitive memory issues) – instead, use persistent labels. Don’t design controls that only appear on hover without an equivalent permanent option (mobile users and keyboard users might never “hover” to find them). By sidestepping these anti-patterns, you save development time and make the interface more robust.
- **Performance and Compatibility**: An often overlooked aspect – a fast, lightweight site benefits users on assistive tech too. For example, a screen reader user benefits from pages that load quickly and don’t bog down their software. Ensure your site/app is cross-browser compatible and consider accessibility on different browsers (some users may be on older AT that works best with certain browsers).

By incorporating these practices, the product will largely be accessible by design, with fewer issues to fix later. In essence, **treat accessibility as a fundamental quality metric of your software**, just like security or performance. Every team member – designers, developers, testers – should be aware of their role in achieving it. Use checklists (like the ones above) during design reviews and code reviews. For example, have an accessibility review checklist for each new feature: Did we include alt text on new images? Are new custom controls keyboard-operable and labeled? Is the new color scheme passing contrast tests? etc. Embedding these questions into your Definition of Done can institutionalize accessibility.

Finally, remember that accessible design often leads to a better overall user experience for everyone.
